With the help of this automated script, you will never lose track of newly released CVEs. What does this powershell script do is exactly running the Microsoft Edge at system startup, navigate to 2 URLs ,and then put the browser in to full screen mode.

    

As ethical hackers, it's vital that we keep track of the recently released CVEs in order to be fully aware of new threats or vulnerabilities out there in the Internet. Actually, it's a routine task in our day to day lives. So why don't we just automate the whole procedure of opening a browser and navigate to our sources for cheking the new CVEs?
The purpose of this tool is to basically, automate the mentioned procedure with the help of powershell scripting. 

Among all the online sources that are available which publish new CVEs, I've chosen the following 2 URLs and leveraged them in the script.


| URLs      |
| ------------- |
| https://cvetrends.com/      |
| https://cve.circl.lu/      |

Also remember that you can even add more URLs to the file.


## Usage:
```
Download the zip file and unzip it on your system
```
```
If you haven't bypassed the script execution on your system, please do so with the command "Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass" 
[Note: it needs to be run as administrator]
```
```
.\CVE_Track.ps1
```
Also, keep in mind the changes that are made to your system can easily be undone, by running the command `.\undo.ps1`

## Technical Analysis:
At first, when you run the script, it will create a *.bat file (*CVE_Track.bat*) in the following directory that literally allows the automation procedure that we aim for.
`C:\Users\<UserName>\\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\` .

Also the file "cv.ps1" is coppied to the directory `C:\Users\<UserName>\` and every time the system starts, it will be executed.

## The script in action

After you've run the script, this is how it would look like when you login to your system after a restart.
